## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. These examples are to help get you started with Java.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src\examples`: the folder has all the examples
- The folders start with a letter to keep in order, and then the name, so ahelloworld is the first example

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
