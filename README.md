## Getting Started

Welcome to the Java world. This was designed to be for students in a robotics program that have some programming experience. 
Usually on our team, students will have looked at CircuitPython already. Python is a bit easier to start with.
However, we use Java on the Robot. These examples are to help get you started with Java.

For more, information see the [github wiki](https://github.com/2491-NoMythic/JavaIntro/wiki) for this project.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains one folder by default, where:

- `src\examples`: the folder has all the examples
- The folders start with a letter to keep in order, and then the name, so a_helloworld is the first example folder. It likely contains a file called HelloWorld.java. Some of the later folders have more than one file/program in them.

## Java Editors

There are two possible editors you can use. VSCode with some Java extensions, and IntelliJ.
The official plugin for building/sending code to the robot that is supplied from first is for VSCode.
See your mentors for hlep installing an editor.
